* Overview

The package occupar (Occupation Classification in R) provides:
1. a handful of functions to convert between different versions of the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO): ISCO-68, ISCO-88, ISCO-08.
2. a set of functions to compute class schemes based on ISCO.

The current package benefited from [[http://www.harryganzeboom.nl/][Harry Ganzeboom]]â€™s work of ISCO and class schemes.
   
* Instalation

# Install the development version (requires the package "devtools", so install it first if it is not installed already)

#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports code
devtools::install_github("DiogoFerrari/occupar")
# If you don't want to update the dependencies, use: (you may need to install some dependencies manually)
devtools::install_github("DiogoFerrari/occupar", dependencies=F)
#+END_SRC

NOTE: it may be necessary to create a token to install the package from the git repository in case it is private (see note at the bottom of help page in R by running =help(install_github)=).

#+NAME: 
#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports code
